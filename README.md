## Introduction

Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm used in operating systems for time-sharing systems. This project provides a basic implementation of the Round Robin algorithm in Python.

## Features

- Preemptive scheduling for fair CPU time allocation.
- Adjustable time quantum for controlling process switching.
- Simple and clear Python code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cseswapon/Round_Robin_Algorithm.git
